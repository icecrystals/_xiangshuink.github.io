*生活是一部小说，需要用热爱书写。 | Life is a novel, you write with your own passion.*

*什么叫失败？也许可以说，人去做一件事情，没有达到预期的目的，这就是失败。但是，那些与命运斗争的人，那些做接近自己限度斗争的人，却天生地接近这种失败。*

*只有那些安于自己限度之内的生活的人才总是“胜利”，这种“胜利者”之所以常胜不败，只是因为他们的对手是早已降服的，或者说，他们根本没有投入斗争。*

*在人生的道路上，“失败”这个词还有另外的含义，即是指人失去了继续斗争的信心，放下了手中的武器。人类向限度屈服，这种才是真正的失败。而没有放下武器，还在继续斗争，继续向限度挑战的人并没有失败*

*胜利就是战斗到最后的时刻。*

*滚滚长江东逝水，浪花淘尽英雄。是非成败转头空。青山依旧在，几度夕阳红。*

*白发渔樵江渚上，惯看秋月春风。一壶浊酒喜相逢。古今多少事，都付笑谈中。*

*New York is 3 hours ahead of California,*

*but it does not make California slow.*

*Someone graduated at the age of 22,*

*but waited 5 years before securing a good job!*

*Someone became a CEO at 25,*

*and died at 50*

*While another became a CEO at 50,*

*and lived to 90 years.*

*Someone is still single,*

*while someone else got married.*

*Obama retires at 55,*

*but Trump starts at 70.*

*Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone.*

*People around you might seem to go ahead of you,*

*some might seem to be behind you.*

*But everyone is running their own RACE, in their own TIME.*

*Don’t envy them or mock them.*

*They are in their TIME ZONE, and you are in yours!*

*Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.*

*So, RELAX.*

*You’re not LATE.*

*You’re not EARLY.*

*You are very much ON TIME, and in your TIME ZONE Destiny set up for you.*

——《You are not too old and it's not too late》
