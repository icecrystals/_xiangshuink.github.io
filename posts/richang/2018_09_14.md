# 留加见闻之一 | 麦基的邮件系统

<span style="font-weight: 400;">三年前，我来交通大学报到。除去办理住宿，领军训服之外，最早做的一件事情就是办理了一张属于自己的校园卡。这张校园卡伴随了我大学三年，并将陪我到顺利毕业。有了这张校园卡，就可以畅通无阻的进出图书馆，宿舍楼，实验室；就可以用来在学生超市购物，作为身份验证等等。</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">在麦基，校园卡当然也极为重要。但比校园卡更加重要的，可能就是学校的邮件系统了。在领到校园卡之前，Registation Office就首先给我分配了一个用自己名字命名的麦基邮箱。与交大存在感极弱的邮箱相比，麦基邮箱起到了校园生活中极其重要的作用。三个月来，我收到了很多来自麦基的“官方邮件”，他们真实的反映了麦基的校园生活。</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">首先，先看一条麦基校规，明确地指出邮箱的地位。</span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-152" src="https://dayday.plus/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-09-13_16-59_000234-300x150.png" alt="" width="506" height="253" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">麦基邮箱承担的最重要的作用当然是信息通知。有些通知很常见，有些通知则很有意思。</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">下图是在18Fall学期开学发给每个学生的邮件。</span>

<img class="alignnone wp-image-154" src="https://dayday.plus/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-09-13_17-00_000235-267x300.png" alt="" width="497" height="558" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">其中介绍了许多新生需要注意的内容，比如</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top 15 Websites for McGill students</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGill’s new smoking policy</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact for all things harassment, discrimination</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration suggestion for SKILL</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leadership Development</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">如果是一个有心的学生，这些内容应该会有极大的帮助。</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">下面一封邮件是关于校园安全的。可见麦基对学生安全的关心。</span>
<blockquote>关于走夜路：请走学校指定的安全路线。如果还是不放心的话，请联系我们，我们陪行！看见可疑情况，请联系以下人员...

我刚来的时候，临近一桩实验楼发生了一起火灾，下面这封邮件是对这场火灾的描述。
<blockquote>医学楼发生了火灾，所幸没有伤亡！那里还很危险，现在请别过去。有急事要去的话，请联系我们。感谢帮忙救火的那些人。
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">On the evening of July 13, a <span id="0.23440877314791986" class="currentHitHighlight">fire</span> was reported on the outdoor terrace of the McIntyre Medical Building. Authorities arrived quickly and the <span id="0.9150160850067648" class="highlight">fire</span> was soon extinguished. No one was injured. We ask that people continue to avoid the area.</span></p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">McIntyre remains closed until further notice. The damage is being assessed and remediation efforts have been underway since late last night.

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Requests for entry into the building to attend to urgent research needs must be communicated to the Security Operations Centre at 514-398-3731, and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis – the first priority will be ensuring the safety of all involved.

<p class="x_MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Damage appears to be limited to the lower floors and basement on the south side of the building, and resulted largely from water deployed during <span id="0.7829746188432503" class="highlight">fire</span>fighting efforts.

然而，安全问题并非都是显而易见的，下面这封邮件说出了一个很敏感的问题。
<blockquote>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">麦基极为重视学生安全。去年我们就颁布了关于避免学生和老师之间的“关系”的文件。但还不够！我们现在专门任命了一个人来负责避免这些行为。他的职责就是找出那些被我们忽视的隐患。</p>

当然，我们要掌握一些自救技能...

以上都是关于安全的通知。麦基的邮件系统还负责很多其他类型的通知。比如，课程的注册确认信，考试确认信，还有一些学习资料的发放。
<blockquote>关于考试的重要信息，不认真读就等着挂科吧！看在你复习这么辛苦的份上，给你些江湖救急药！

还有校长的亲自来信。
<blockquote>大家好，我是校长。在我的地盘，大家尽情玩。有啥不开心告诉我，毕竟我能为所欲为，（逃

I would like to welcome you all to the new academic year. There is a special energy that fills our campuses at the start of the fall semester.  The coming months will be filled with your ideas and projects, and I am excited to learn about them.

Even as the semester gets busy, I encourage each of you—whether you are new to McGill or a long-time member of our community—to make time to explore our University and discover everything it has to offer. Whether you are interested in sports or science, music or medicine, there is always something inspiring, thought-provoking or simply fun to do at McGill. Like our wonderful home city of Montreal, McGill’s campuses abound with talented, creative people who are doing amazing things. Please support them.

I look forward to our working together as a community. If you have any thoughts to share throughout the year, you can reach me at XXX@mcgill.ca. <span lang="FR-CA">Welcome</span><span lang="FR-CA"> back!</span></blockquote>
以上皆为玩笑，作为加拿大本科教育第一名校（约等于加拿大的清华北大吧），对于好学生当然有更高的要求和更好的福利。
<blockquote>荣誉学位（约等于中国的实验班）：来到这里，只要学不死，就往死里学！生命在于挑战，欢迎加入。

<strong>MCGILL HONORARY DEGREES</strong>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">McGill honorary degrees are awarded to distinguished individuals in recognition of a lifetime of scholarly, scientific or artistic achievement, or for exceptional contribution to the public good through professional or philanthropic activity. Individuals selected to receive an honorary degree will have a record of contribution and accomplishments that positions them to be an inspiration and role model to our students, graduates and our university community, and to enhance the reputation of McGill.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Consistent with the primary criteria of excellence of achievement and exceptional contribution, the University may honour individuals whose outstanding contributions to their fields or to society may not yet have been widely recognized, as well as those who have received recognition.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">Through its recommendations of outstanding individuals, the Committee will endeavor to reflect the intellectual and cultural diversity of the McGill community and the broader communities in Quebec and Canada, as well as the international impact and reach of the University. In order to make it possible for the Committee to achieve this goal, I encourage you to nominate candidates who reflect the diversity of our larger society.</p>
<p class="x_MsoNormal">The award of an honorary degree is an important statement of recognition and respect from the University to the broader community. It is also an excellent way to build special relationships between our faculties, departments and outstanding individuals who symbolize the best of our institution.</p>

对于好学生，奖学金当然是标配。
<blockquote>

除此之外，麦基邮件还有一些其他功能，比如云打印：给特定邮箱发文件就可以去图书馆打印出来。

还有发布学生希望的放假信息...

这里我想说一个麦基邮箱的贴心功能。就是他真正把所有麦基的学生和老师联系成了一个社区。何以见得？发送邮件时，只要你输入几个字母，他就会联想出相关的学生和教师邮箱。

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-164" src="https://dayday.plus/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2018-09-13_17-47_000238-206x300.png" alt="" width="206" height="300" />

&nbsp;

<hr />

可见，邮箱真的是渗透到了麦基大学生活的方方面面，有着举足轻重的作用。因为邮箱，同学养成了查邮件的习惯，发邮件当然也就变得理所当然了：在我们实验室里，一些重要信息的发布都是通过邮件列表，这在之后的文章里再说。

与麦基相比，交大学生一般没有使用校园邮箱的习惯。我觉得一方面是因为没有校规规定重要的信息需要通过邮件发送，另一方面是交大的邮箱系统真是...不知道招标给了一个什么不知名的公司做的系统，用起来太扎心了。倒不如学习McGill，直接使用Outlook作为邮箱程序，同时还可以和Office365打包使用，不能更方便。

交大的通知一般通过QQ群发布，这也有利有弊。利在方便文件传送与存储，弊在消息容易被刷没，而且有些人因为各种各样的原因并不使用QQ。当然，McGill也有自己的Facebook群组，应该可以解决文件相关的问题，只不过我没有加入，不太清楚罢了。
